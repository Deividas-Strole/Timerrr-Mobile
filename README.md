# A Mobile Timer App with Note-Taking and Saving Capability

**Description:**

This app was built using Flutter and Dart, with some Kotlin integration. Since it relies on certain native OS functions (like calculating time even when the phone is asleep), it currently runs on Android devices only. The app stores notes locally on the device using SharedPreferences â€” a lightweight key-value storage solution in Flutter. No external database (like SQLite or Firebase) is used.
